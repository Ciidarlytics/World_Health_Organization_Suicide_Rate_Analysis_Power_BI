# World_Health_Organization_Suicide_Rate_Analysis_Power_BI
This data analysis project uses Power BI to provide insightful dashboards and reports to aid in the prevention of suicidal factors and the reduction of suicide rates.
I analyzed and presented a dataset provided by the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) on global suicide rates. The dataset consists of key variables, including Country, Year, Sex, Number of Suicides, Populations, Suicides per 100 thousand population, GDP, GDP per capita, and Generations, I executed a comprehensive analysis using Microsoft Power BI and presented my findings based on specific queries.

## Key Findings: 

•Total Suicides (1985-2016): Over the last course of 32 years, there was a total number of 7 million suicides recorded worldwide, of which 5 million were males and 2 million were females. The collective GDP during this period was $516.66 trillion, with a GDP per capita of $469.23 million and a global population of 51 billion. 

•Countries with the Highest and Lowest Suicide Rates: The Russian Federation had the highest suicide rate, with 1.21 million suicides, followed by the United States (1.03 million), Japan (0.81 million), and France (0.33 million), Ukraine (0.32 million). Conversely, Dominica, Saint Kuwait, New Zealand, Slovakia, Uruguay, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Ireland, Greece, Israel, Slovenia, South Africa, Estonia, and Costa Rica recorded the lowest suicide rates (0.01 million). 

•Regional Insights: Asia recorded the highest suicide rates, whereas Africa registered the lowest. 

•Age group with High suicide rate: 75+ years were the highest, closely followed by 55-74 years, 25-34 years exhibit lower suicide rates compared to older adults but are still notably affected, 5-14 years age group recorded the lowest suicide rates.

•Trends Over Time (1985-2016): Suicide rates observed an upward trend from 116,063 in 1985 to peak at 246,725 in 1996, followed by fluctuations and a steep decline to 15,603 by 2016. 

•Correlation between Suicide rate and GDP per Capital: The analysis indicated an inverse correlation between GDP per capita and suicide rates; as GDP per capita increased, suicide rates showed a general decrease.

## Proposed Solutions:  
Based on these findings, I recommend the following actions.

• Global Mental Health Campaigns: Launch awareness programs to reduce stigmatization promote mental health support and encourage individuals to seek professional help.

• Improved Mental Health Services: Telehealth services should be expanded to make mental support more accessible, particularly for people in remote or rural areas.

• Regulation of Harmful Materials: Implement policies to limit access to common methods of suicide, such as firearms, pesticides, and medications.

• Economic and Social Policies: Develop policies that promote job growth, economic stability, and financial security to reduce economic stressors that can contribute to suicidal thoughts.
